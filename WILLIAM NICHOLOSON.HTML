            <h2><p>Nicholson was at various times a hydraulic engineer, inventor, translator, and scientific publicist. He invented a hydrometer (an instrument for measuring the density of liquids) in 1790. In 1800, after he heard of the invention of the electric battery by the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta, he built one of his own. He then discovered that when leads from the battery are placed in water, the water breaks up into hydrogen and oxygen, which colleparaately to form bubbles at the submerged ends of the wires. with his discovery NICHOLSON became the first man to produce a chemical reaction by electricity.</p></h2>
